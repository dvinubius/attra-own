# Attra - Ethereum app for incentive-boosted crowdfunding

## Hack

This project was submitted to the [Chainlink Hackathon](https://chain.link/hackathon) (Fall 2021)

## ðŸš§ ðŸ›  ðŸ’» Work in progress - follow for updates!

Was submitted on deadline, needs more work even as a prototype.

### Backend
Solidity contracts are fine. 
All interactions with campaign contract go through main contract. Would have been cleaner if direct. Design choice made due to Moralis limitations. (could not sync events with user-created contracts)

### React
Planned improvements:
- UX polish
- bug fixes
- Code design

## Try it on [Rinkeby](https://attra.vercel.app/home) ðŸ¤©

Make sure to connect metamask in order to use the app (there are no UX guardrails, it's merely a prototype)
